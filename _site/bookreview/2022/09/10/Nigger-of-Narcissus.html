<meta name="description" content="A very descriptive maritime novel. The Nigger of Narcissus is often considered Conrad’s best work from his early years. The seafaring life is very well described, specially the bonds the shipmates shared. I consider this book an excellent candidate for junior /high school English reading; Great language and characterization and a meaningful plot with beautiful imagery. Perhaps it’s the N word in the title that makes it an uncomfortable addition to a curriculum, but one can adopt one of the many alternate titles since Nigger here is used in literal sense to indicate a certain black man called James Wait from the West Indies, the word holding no significance beyond that." />
