## Welcome to my Art Corner

I dabble in water color painting and scribble sketching. Most of the work here (the good ones atleast) is my humble effort to replicate works of popular works by other artists on Pintrest and Instagram. My main interests are in Figurative art and portraits. My primary inspirations are the French painter [Adolphe Bouguereau](https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-adolphe-bouguereau), Russian Oil Painter [Vladimir Volegov](https://volegov.com/) and the most awesome watercolor artist from Brazil [Marcos Beccari](https://www.instagram.com/marcosbeccari/). I hope to get into Portrait Oil Painting someday.

Checkout my Instagram page [mr.praky](https://www.instagram.com/mr.praky/) for the few occasional paintings I do get time to churn out. DM me to accept your friend invite !
