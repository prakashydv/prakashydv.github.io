This book deserves its popularity, it is among the most compelling non-fiction I've read so far. "The Psychology of Money" lays bare the truth behind intuition regarding money, how personal it is and how unpredictable. The language is the book's single most appealing point. Simple and captivating, Morgan has mixed plenty on anecdotes to make the statistics digestible, something Kahneman didn't do as well in "Thinking Fast and Slow".
This is one book I would highly recommend to everyone. The ideal time would've been when you are early in your career and fortunate enough to invest some of your income. I wish I had read it earlier, I would've invested in Index funds a lot sooner for sure ! It's interesting to find out how I have let my meagre experience with money define the entire narrative I tell myself on how money works, and believe me, you've done this too.
