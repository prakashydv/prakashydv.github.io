summary: "Review of the book Siddhartha (Hermann Hesse)"
---

I had to re-read it after a gap of ten years because one day in a conversation I realized my memory of the book was entirely different from what I had actually read. I was recalling my own version of Siddhartha rather than what Herman Hesse had composed. Somewhere down the line I even reiterated original thoughts from this book as my own, things had got that bad ! So here I am rereading a book, something I seldom do. Regardless, it was a different experience considering I am a different person than I was 10 years ago. 'Siddhartha' is a take on oriental thought with an occidental flavour. Herman Hesse is lucid in his narrative, crisp in delivery of his ideas. A short read, and a good use of spare time.
