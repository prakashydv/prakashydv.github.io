There is no easy way to say this, but you have no free will. It's not as alarming as it sounds, let me elaborate. It's more like that you posses the freedom of will for a small fraction of your life,just your childhood. Everythingromthre on is just a manifestation of your partially formed judgement ofhowthe world works. Your circumstances of your chldhood define pretty much the rest oyour life. Unless somethingdrastic occurs inyour adulthoo, you are likely to become a slave to your predictiility. You prefer things a certain way, andthatway tells a storyaboutyour past,and predicts the future as well.
